Packet capturing, analyzing and extraction of security related data in Java.

Recommended working environment: _IntelliJ IDEA (community), jnetpcap, Windows 8.1_

### What's been done

- read packets from a capture file (pcap)
- store (only) the header info (in memory)
- filter them with header info (only)

### What needs to happen

- change the in-memory storage system
- a GUI
- live capture module
- ability to save them to disk

Currently, this is being developed under academic-project restrictions; but in a month, 
the codebase and the ideas will be open to the general public. :-)

Founders: _Nirmal Lankathilaka, Narmadaa Baalasooriya, Madusha Jayawardhana_.
