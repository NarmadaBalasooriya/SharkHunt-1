Packet capturing, analyzing and extraction of security related data in Java.

Recommended working environment: _IntelliJ IDEA (community), jNetPcap, Windows 8.1_

### planned development milestones

- [x] read packets from a capture file (pcap)
- [x] store (only) the header info (in memory)
- [x] filter them with header info (only)
- [ ] change the in-memory storage system
- [ ] a GUI
- [ ] live capture module
- [ ] ability to save them to disk

These are just the initial goals. Once they're accomplished, we'll be moving on to much more interesting and hacking-related stuff.

Currently, this is being developed under academic-project restrictions; but in a month, 
the codebase and the ideas will be open to the general public. :-)

Founders: _Nirmal Lankathilaka, Narmadaa Baalasooriya, Madusha Jayawardhana_.
